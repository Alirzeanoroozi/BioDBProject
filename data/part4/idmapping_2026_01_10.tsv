Note=Enriched in chromatin in response to ultaviolet (UV) light (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:34179826). Binds to chromatin during early G1 (PubMed:24989122). Recruited to DNA damage sites, such as double-stranded breaks (DSBs), following interaction with TOPBP1 and RHNO1 (PubMed:37440612, PubMed:37674080). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24989122, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25642963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34179826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37440612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37674080}.	FUNCTION: Low-fidelity DNA polymerase with a helicase activity that promotes microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), an alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery required to repair double-strand breaks in DNA during mitosis (PubMed:14576298, PubMed:18503084, PubMed:24648516, PubMed:25642963, PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:26636256, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252, PubMed:30655289, PubMed:31562312, PubMed:32873648, PubMed:34140467, PubMed:34179826, PubMed:36455556, PubMed:37440612, PubMed:37674080). MMEJ is an error-prone repair pathway that produces deletions of sequences from the strand being repaired and promotes genomic rearrangements, such as telomere fusions, some of them leading to cellular transformation (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252, PubMed:31562312, PubMed:32873648). MMEJ is required during mitosis to repair persistent double-strand breaks that originate in S-phase (PubMed:37440612, PubMed:37674080). Although error-prone, MMEJ protects against chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (By similarity). The polymerase acts by binding directly the 2 ends of resected double-strand breaks, allowing microhomologous sequences in the overhangs to form base pairs (PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252). It then extends each strand from the base-paired region using the opposing overhang as a template (PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252). Requires partially resected DNA containing 2 to 6 base pairs of microhomology to perform MMEJ (PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252). The polymerase lacks proofreading activity and is highly promiscuous: unlike most polymerases, promotes extension of ssDNA and partial ssDNA (pssDNA) substrates (PubMed:18503084, PubMed:21050863, PubMed:22135286). When the ends of a break do not contain terminal microhomology must identify embedded complementary sequences through a scanning step (PubMed:32234782). Also acts as a DNA helicase, promoting dissociation of the replication protein A complex (RPA/RP-A), composed of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3, from resected double-strand breaks to allow their annealing and subsequent joining by MMEJ (PubMed:36455556). Removal of RPA/RP-A complex proteins prevents RAD51 accumulation at resected ends, thereby inhibiting homology-recombination repair (HR) pathway (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:28695890). Also shows RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity to mediate DNA repair in vitro; however this activity needs additional evidence in vivo (PubMed:34117057). May also have lyase activity (PubMed:19188258). Involved in somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, a process that requires the activity of DNA polymerases to ultimately introduce mutations at both A/T and C/G base pairs (By similarity). POLQ-mediated end joining activity is involved in random integration of exogenous DNA hampers (PubMed:28695890). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CGS6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14576298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18503084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21050863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22135286, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24648516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25642963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25643323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25775267, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26636256, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27311885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27591252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28695890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30655289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31562312, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32234782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32873648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34117057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34140467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34179826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36455556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37440612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37674080}.	base-excision repair [GO:0006284]; DNA damage response [GO:0006974]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; double-strand break repair [GO:0006302]; double-strand break repair via alternative nonhomologous end joining [GO:0097681]; error-prone translesion synthesis [GO:0042276]; negative regulation of double-strand break repair via homologous recombination [GO:2000042]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; replication fork processing [GO:0031297]; somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes [GO:0016446]	IPR011545;IPR019760;IPR001098;IPR043502;IPR002298;IPR057220;IPR014001;IPR001650;IPR046931;IPR027417;IPR048960;IPR012337;IPR036397;	PF00270;PF00476;PF25453;PF00271;PF20470;PF21099;

FUNCTION: Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol derivatives at position 3 of the inositol ring to produce 3-phosphoinositides (PubMed:15135396). Uses ATP and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PubMed:15135396). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Involved in the activation of AKT1 upon stimulation by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) ligands such as CXCL12, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and lysophosphatidic acid. May also act downstream receptor tyrosine kinases. Required in different signaling pathways for stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. Plays a role in platelet activation signaling triggered by GPCRs, alpha-IIb/beta-3 integrins (ITGA2B/ ITGB3) and ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-bearing receptors such as GP6. Regulates the strength of adhesion of ITGA2B/ ITGB3 activated receptors necessary for the cellular transmission of contractile forces. Required for platelet aggregation induced by F2 (thrombin) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Has a role in cell survival. May have a role in cell migration. Involved in the early stage of autophagosome formation. Modulates the intracellular level of PtdIns3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) and activates PIK3C3 kinase activity. May act as a scaffold, independently of its lipid kinase activity to positively regulate autophagy. May have a role in insulin signaling as scaffolding protein in which the lipid kinase activity is not required. May have a kinase-independent function in regulating cell proliferation and in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mediator of oncogenic signal in cell lines lacking PTEN. The lipid kinase activity is necessary for its role in oncogenic transformation. Required for the growth of ERBB2 and RAS driven tumors. Also has a protein kinase activity showing autophosphorylation (PubMed:12502714). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12502714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15135396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18594509, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18755892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21030680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21383062}.	angiogenesis involved in wound healing [GO:0060055]; autophagy [GO:0006914]; cell migration [GO:0016477]; cell surface receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway [GO:0007169]; chemotaxis [GO:0006935]; embryonic cleavage [GO:0040016]; endocytosis [GO:0006897]; endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001935]; G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007186]; homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules [GO:0007156]; intracellular calcium ion homeostasis [GO:0006874]; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity [GO:0042267]; negative regulation of hypoxia-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:1903298]; negative regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043409]; negative regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction [GO:0051898]; negative regulation of sprouting angiogenesis [GO:1903671]; negative regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway [GO:1900747]; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction [GO:0043491]; phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthetic process [GO:0046854]; phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate biosynthetic process [GO:0036092]; phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling [GO:0048015]; platelet activation [GO:0030168]; platelet aggregation [GO:0070527]; positive regulation of autophagy [GO:0010508]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]; positive regulation of neutrophil apoptotic process [GO:0033031]; positive regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process [GO:0045429]; positive regulation of Rac protein signal transduction [GO:0035022]; regulation of cell-matrix adhesion [GO:0001952]; regulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:2000369]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor signaling pathway [GO:0003376]	IPR016024;IPR035892;IPR011009;IPR000403;IPR036940;IPR018936;IPR002420;IPR003113;IPR001263;IPR042236;IPR000341;IPR037702;IPR015433;IPR029071;	PF00454;PF00792;PF02192;PF00794;PF00613;

FUNCTION: Transcription factor that mediates a transcriptional program in various innate and adaptive immune tissue-resident lymphocyte T cell types such as tissue-resident memory T (Trm), natural killer (trNK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells and negatively regulates gene expression of proteins that promote the egress of tissue-resident T-cell populations from non-lymphoid organs. Plays a role in the development, retention and long-term establishment of adaptive and innate tissue-resident lymphocyte T cell types in non-lymphoid organs, such as the skin and gut, but also in other nonbarrier tissues like liver and kidney, and therefore may provide immediate immunological protection against reactivating infections or viral reinfection (By similarity).

FUNCTION: May function as a linker between cadherin adhesion receptors and the cytoskeleton to regulate cell-cell adhesion and differentiation in the nervous system (By similarity). Required for proper regulation of cortical neuronal migration and neurite growth (PubMed:30013181).

FUNCTION: Involved in mitotic spindle regulation and coordination of mitotic processes. The function in regulating microtubule dynamics at spindle poles including spindle orientation, astral microtubule density and poleward microtubule flux seems to depend on the association with the katanin complex formed by KATNA1 and KATNB1. Enhances the microtubule lattice severing activity of KATNA1 by recruiting the katanin complex to microtubules. Can block microtubule minus-end growth and reversely this function can be enhanced by the katanin complex (PubMed:28436967).

FUNCTION: Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for fibroblast growth factors and plays an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis, and in the regulation of embryonic development. Required for normal embryonic patterning, trophoblast function, limb bud development, lung morphogenesis, osteogenesis and skin development. Plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is required for normal skeleton development. Promotes cell proliferation in keratinocytes and immature osteoblasts, but promotes apoptosis in differentiated osteoblasts. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2 and PAK4. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. FGFR2 signaling is down-regulated by ubiquitination, internalization and degradation. Mutations that lead to constitutive kinase activation or impair normal FGFR2 maturation, internalization and degradation lead to aberrant signaling. Over-expressed FGFR2 promotes activation of STAT1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12529371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15190072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15629145, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16384934, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16597617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17311277, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17623664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18374639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19103595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19387476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19410646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21596750, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663044}.	angiogenesis [GO:0001525];

At the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts, colocalizes with DDX3X (PubMed:28733330). Relocalizes to cytoplasmic stress granules upon cellular stress where it colocalizes with ENDOV (PubMed:27573237).

FUNCTION: Binds the poly(A) tail of mRNA, including that of its own transcript, and regulates processes of mRNA metabolism such as pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA stability (PubMed:11051545, PubMed:17212783, PubMed:25480299). Its function in translational initiation regulation can either be enhanced by PAIP1 or repressed by PAIP2 (PubMed:11051545, PubMed:20573744). Can probably bind to cytoplasmic RNA sequences other than poly(A) in vivo. Binds to N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs and contributes to MYC stability by binding to m6A-containing MYC mRNAs (PubMed:32245947). Involved in translationally coupled mRNA turnover (PubMed:11051545). Implicated with other RNA-binding proteins in the cytoplasmic deadenylation/translational and decay interplay of the FOS mRNA mediated by the major coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD) domain (PubMed:11051545). Involved in regulation of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons; for the recognition of premature termination codons (PTC) and initiation of NMD a competitive interaction between UPF1 and PABPC1 with the ribosome-bound release factors is proposed (PubMed:18447585). By binding to long poly(A) tails, may protect them from uridylation by ZCCHC6/ZCCHC11 and hence contribute to mRNA stability (PubMed:25480299). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11051545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17212783, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18447585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20573744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25480299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32245947}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Positively regulates the replication of dengue virus (DENV). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26735137}.

FUNCTION: DNA/RNA-binding protein that plays a role in various cellular processes such as transcription regulation, RNA splicing, RNA transport, DNA repair and damage response (PubMed:27731383). Binds to ssRNA containing the consensus sequence 5'-AGGUAA-3' (PubMed:21256132). Binds to nascent pre-mRNAs and acts as a molecular mediator between RNA polymerase II and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein thereby coupling transcription and splicing (PubMed:26124092). Also binds its own pre-mRNA and autoregulates its expression; this autoregulation mechanism is mediated by non-sense-mediated decay (PubMed:24204307).

FUNCTION: Core component of the BAF (hSWI/SNF) complex. This ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex plays important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, in cellular antiviral activities and inhibition of tumor formation. The BAF complex is able to create a stable, altered form of chromatin that constrains fewer negative supercoils than normal. This change in supercoiling would be due to the conversion of up to one-half of the nucleosomes on polynucleosomal arrays into asymmetric structures, termed altosomes, each composed of 2 histones octamers. Stimulates in vitro the remodeling activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A. Involved in activation of CSF1 promoter. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Plays a key role in cell-cycle control and causes cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0H3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12226744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604992, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9448295}.	blastocyst hatching [GO:0001835]; chromatin remodeling [GO:0006338]; DNA integration [GO:0015074]; hepatocyte differentiation [GO:0070365]; negative regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008285]; nervous system development [GO:0007399]; nucleosome disassembly [GO:0006337]; positive regulation by host of viral transcription [GO:0043923]; positive regulation of cell differentiation [GO:0045597]; positive regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000781]; positive regulation of glucose mediated signaling pathway [GO:1902661]; positive regulation of myoblast differentiation [GO:0045663]; positive regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902459]; positive regulation of T cell differentiation [GO:0045582]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; positive regulation of transcription of nucleolar large rRNA by RNA polymerase I [GO:1901838]; regulation of G0 to G1 transition [GO:0070316]; regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:2000045]; regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition [GO:0030071]; regulation of nucleotide-excision repair [GO:2000819]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]; RNA polymerase I preinitiation complex assembly [GO:0001188]; single stranded viral RNA replication via double stranded DNA intermediate [GO:0039692]; transcription initiation-coupled chromatin remodeling [GO:0045815]	IPR048664;IPR017393;IPR006939;	PF21459;PF04855;

FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Binds DNA non-specifically. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2BH40, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12672490, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.	chromatin remodeling [GO:0006338]; nervous system development [GO:0007399]; nucleosome disassembly [GO:0006337]; positive regulation of cell differentiation [GO:0045597]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; positive regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000781]; positive regulation of myoblast differentiation [GO:0045663]; positive regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902459]; positive regulation of T cell differentiation [GO:0045582]; regulation of G0 to G1 transition [GO:0070316]; regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:2000045]; regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition [GO:0030071]; regulation of nucleotide-excision repair [GO:2000819]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]; transcription initiation-coupled chromatin remodeling [GO:0045815]	IPR030094;IPR001606;IPR036431;IPR011989;IPR016024;IPR021906;IPR033388;	PF01388;PF12031;

Uses ATP and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PubMed:15135396, PubMed:28676499). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Participates in cellular signaling in response to various growth factors. Involved in the activation of AKT1 upon stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases ligands such as EGF, insulin, IGF1, VEGFA and PDGF. Involved in signaling via insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Essential in endothelial cell migration during vascular development through VEGFA signaling, possibly by regulating RhoA activity. Required for lymphatic vasculature development, possibly by binding to RAS and by activation by EGF and FGF2, but not by PDGF. Regulates invadopodia formation through the PDPK1-AKT1 pathway. Participates in cardiomyogenesis in embryonic stem cells through a AKT1 pathway. Participates in vasculogenesis in embryonic stem cells through PDK1 and protein kinase C pathway. In addition to its lipid kinase activity, it displays a serine-protein kinase activity that results in the autophosphorylation of the p85alpha regulatory subunit as well as phosphorylation of other proteins such as 4EBP1, H-Ras, the IL-3 beta c receptor and possibly others (PubMed:23936502, PubMed:28676499).

FUNCTION: Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFA, VEGFC and VEGFD. Plays an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular development, vascular permeability, and embryonic hematopoiesis. Promotes proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA- and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1. Required for VEGFA-mediated induction of NOS2 and NOS3, leading to the production of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells. Phosphorylates PLCG1. Promotes phosphorylation of FYN, NCK1, NOS3, PIK3R1, PTK2/FAK1 and SRC. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10102632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10368301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10600473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12649282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1417831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15026417, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15215251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15962004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16966330, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17303569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18529047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19668192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19834490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20080685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20224550, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20705758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21893193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25825981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7929439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9160888, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9804796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9837777}.	angiogenesis [GO:0001525]; blood vessel endothelial cell differentiation [GO:0060837]; branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis [GO:0001569]; calcium ion homeostasis [GO:0055074]; cell fate commitment [GO:0045165]; cell migration [GO:0016477]; cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis [GO:0002042]; cell surface receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway [GO:0007169]; cellular response to hydrogen sulfide [GO:1904881]; cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus [GO:0035924]; embryonic hemopoiesis [GO:0035162]; endocardium development [GO:0003157]; endothelial cell differentiation [GO:0045446]; endothelium development [GO:0003158]; epithelial cell maturation [GO:0002070]; epithelial cell proliferation [GO:0050673]; lung alveolus development [GO:0048286]; lymph vessel development [GO:0001945]; mesenchymal cell proliferation [GO:0010463]; negative regulation of endothelial cell apoptotic process [GO:2000352]; negative regulation of gene expression [GO:0010629]; negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process [GO:0043524]; ovarian follicle development [GO:0001541]; peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation [GO:0018108]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]; positive regulation of BMP signaling pathway [GO:0030513]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis [GO:0090050]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis [GO:2001028]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001938]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of focal adhesion assembly [GO:0051894]; positive regulation of macroautophagy [GO:0016239]; positive regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043410]; positive regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation [GO:0002053]; positive regulation of mitochondrial depolarization [GO:0051901]; positive regulation of mitochondrial fission [GO:0090141]; positive regulation of nitric oxide-cGMP mediated signal transduction [GO:0141150]; positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction [GO:0051897]; positive regulation of positive chemotaxis [GO:0050927]; positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]; positive regulation of stem cell proliferation [GO:2000648]; positive regulation of vasculogenesis [GO:2001214]; post-embryonic camera-type eye morphogenesis [GO:0048597]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; regulation of bone development [GO:1903010]; regulation of cell shape [GO:0008360]; regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation [GO:1901532]; regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043408]; semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway [GO:0071526]; stem cell proliferation [GO:0072089]; surfactant homeostasis [GO:0043129]; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048010]; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 signaling pathway [GO:0036324]; vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway [GO:0038084]; vascular wound healing [GO:0061042]; vasculogenesis [GO:0001570]	IPR007110;IPR036179;IPR013783;IPR013098;IPR003599;IPR003598;IPR013151;IPR011009;IPR000719;IPR017441;IPR050122;IPR001245;IPR008266;IPR020635;IPR001824;IPR041348;IPR055229;IPR055238;IPR009136;	PF07679;PF00047;PF13895;PF22971;PF07714;PF21339;PF17988;PF22854;

FUNCTION: Negative regulator of YAP1 in the Hippo signaling pathway that plays a pivotal role in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis (PubMed:10518011, PubMed:10831611, PubMed:18158288, PubMed:26437443, PubMed:28068668). The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein STK3/MST2 and STK4/MST1, in complex with its regulatory protein SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ (PubMed:18158288, PubMed:26437443, PubMed:28068668). Phosphorylation of YAP1 by LATS1 inhibits its translocation into the nucleus to regulate cellular genes important for cell proliferation, cell death, and cell migration (PubMed:18158288, PubMed:26437443, PubMed:28068668). Acts as a tumor suppressor which plays a critical role in maintenance of ploidy through its actions in both mitotic progression and the G1 tetraploidy checkpoint (PubMed:15122335, PubMed:19927127). Negatively regulates G2/M transition by down-regulating CDK1 kinase activity (PubMed:9988268). Involved in the control of p53 expression (PubMed:15122335). Affects cytokinesis by regulating actin polymerization through negative modulation of LIMK1 (PubMed:15220930). May also play a role in endocrine function. Plays a role in mammary gland epithelial cell differentiation, both through the Hippo signaling pathway and the intracellular estrogen receptor signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of ESR1 (PubMed:28068668). Acts as an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome by mediating phosphorylation of 'Ser-265' of NLRP3 following NLRP3 palmitoylation, promoting NLRP3 activation by NEK7 (PubMed:39173637). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518011, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10831611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15122335, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15220930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18158288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19927127, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26437443, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28068668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:39173637, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9988268}.	cell division [GO:0051301]; G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000082]; G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000086]; hippo signaling [GO:0035329]; hormone-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0009755]; inner cell mass cell fate commitment [GO:0001827]; inner cell mass cellular morphogenesis [GO:0001828]; keratinocyte differentiation [GO:0030216]; mammary gland epithelial cell differentiation [GO:0060644]; negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090090]; negative regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0045736]; negative regulation of protein localization to nucleus [GO:1900181]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly [GO:1900227]; protein localization [GO:0008104]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of actin filament polymerization [GO:0030833]; regulation of intracellular estrogen receptor signaling pathway [GO:0033146]; regulation of organ growth [GO:0046620]; regulation of postsynaptic density assembly [GO:0099151]; regulation of protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0043254]; regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway [GO:0017015]; regulation of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:2000058]; sister chromatid segregation [GO:0000819]	IPR000961;IPR011009;IPR049761;IPR042706;IPR017892;IPR000719;IPR008271;IPR050236;IPR015940;IPR009060;	PF00069;PF00433;PF00627;

FUNCTION: A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Primarily catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes all trans-retinoic acid toward its 4-hydroxylated form (PubMed:11093772). Displays 16-alpha hydroxylase activity toward estrogen steroid hormones, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) (PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol) (PubMed:26427316). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11093772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14559847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15766564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965576, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26427316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7574697}.	epoxygenase P450 pathway [GO:0019373]; estrogen metabolic process [GO:0008210]; icosanoid biosynthetic process [GO:0046456]; lipid hydroxylation [GO:0002933]; long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process [GO:0042759]; omega-hydroxylase P450 pathway [GO:0097267]; organic acid metabolic process [GO:0006082]; oxidative demethylation [GO:0070989]; retinoic acid metabolic process [GO:0042573]; retinol metabolic process [GO:0042572]; steroid metabolic process [GO:0008202]; xenobiotic catabolic process [GO:0042178]; xenobiotic metabolic process [GO:0006805]	IPR001128;IPR017972;IPR002401;IPR036396;IPR050182;	PF00067;

Chromosome {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3URK3}. Note=During DNA replication, localizes to sites of ongoing DNA replication in heterochromatin (in late S phase) in an UHRF1- and CRL4(VprBP)-dependent manner, as a consequence of ubiquitination of the conserved residue Lys-1589. Localization to heterochromatin is independent of catalytic activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:36056023}.	FUNCTION: Dioxygenase that plays a key role in active DNA demethylation, by catalyzing the sequential oxidation of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (PubMed:19372391, PubMed:21496894, PubMed:21778364, PubMed:35798741). In addition to its role in DNA demethylation, plays a more general role in chromatin regulation by recruiting histone modifying protein complexes to alter histone marks and chromatin accessibility, leading to both activation and repression of gene expression (PubMed:33833093). Plays therefore a role in many biological processes, including stem cell maintenance, T- and B-cell development, inflammation regulation, genomic imprinting, neural activity or DNA repair (PubMed:31278917). Involved in the balance between pluripotency and lineage commitment of cells and plays a role in embryonic stem cells maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification. Together with QSER1, plays an essential role in the protection and maintenance of transcriptional and developmental programs to inhibit the binding of DNMT3A/3B and therefore de novo methylation (PubMed:33833093). May play a role in pancreatic beta-cell specification during development. In this context, may function as an upstream epigenetic regulator of PAX4 presumably through direct recruitment by FOXA2 to a PAX4 enhancer to preserve its unmethylated status, thereby potentiating PAX4 expression to adopt beta-cell fate during endocrine lineage commitment (PubMed:35798741). Under DNA hypomethylation conditions, such as in female meiotic germ cells, may induce epigenetic reprogramming of pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH), the constitutive heterochromatin of pericentromeric regions. PCH forms chromocenters in the interphase nucleus and chromocenters cluster at the prophase of meiosis. In this context, may also be essential for chromocenter clustering in a catalytic activity-independent manner, possibly through the recruitment polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to the chromocenters (By similarity). During embryonic development, may be required for normal meiotic progression in oocytes and meiotic gene activation (By similarity). Binds preferentially to DNA containing cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides over CpH (H=A, T, and C), hemimethylated-CpG and hemimethylated-hydroxymethyl-CpG (PubMed:29276034). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3URK3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124344, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19372391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19372393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21496894, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21778364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25284789, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29276034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31278917, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33833093, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35798741}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Dioxygenase that plays a key role in active DNA demethylation (PubMed:28531272). Binds to promoters, particularly to those with high CG content (By similarity). In hippocampal neurons, isoform 1 regulates the expression of a unique subset of genes compared to isoform 2, although some overlap exists between both isoforms, hence differentially regulates excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). In hippocampal neuron cell cultures, isoform 1 controls both miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude and frequency (By similarity). Isoform 1 may regulate genes involved in hippocampal-dependent memory, leading to positive regulation of memory, contrary to isoform 2 that may decrease memory (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3URK3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28531272}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Dioxygenase that plays a key role in active DNA demethylation (PubMed:28531272). As isoform 1, binds to promoters, particularly to those with high CG content, however displays reduced global chromatin affinity compared with isoform 1, leading to decreased global DNA demethylation compared with isoform 1 (By similarity). Contrary to isoform 1, isoform 2 localizes during S phase to sites of ongoing DNA replication in heterochromatin, causing a significant de novo 5hmC formation, globally, and more so in heterochromatin, including LINE 1 interspersed DNA repeats leading to their activation (By similarity). In hippocampal neurons, isoform 2 regulates the expression of a unique subset of genes compared to isoform 1, although some overlap between both isoforms, hence differentially regulates excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). In hippocampal neuron cell cultures, isoform 2 controls miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency, but not amplitude (By similarity). Isoform 2 may regulate genes involved in hippocampal-dependent memory, leading to negative regulation of memory, contrary to isoform 1 that may improve memory (By similarity). In immature and partially differentiated gonadotrope cells, directly represses luteinizing hormone gene LHB expression and does not catalyze 5hmC at the gene promoter (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3URK3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28531272}.	cellular response to reactive oxygen species [GO:0034614]; chromatin remodeling [GO:0006338]; chromosomal 5-methylcytosine DNA demethylation, oxidation pathway [GO:0141167]; inner cell mass cell differentiation [GO:0001826]; negative regulation of cell migration [GO:0030336]; negative regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902455]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway [GO:0030512]; positive regulation of gene expression via chromosomal CpG island demethylation [GO:0044029]; positive regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902459]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; protein O-linked glycosylation [GO:0006493]; stem cell population maintenance [GO:0019827]	IPR024779;IPR040175;IPR046942;IPR002857;	PF12851;PF02008;

Note=Concentrates in nuclear foci during S phase and upon genotoxic stress. At the onset of mitosis, excluded from chromosomes and diffuses into the cytoplasm, returning to the nucleus at the end of cell division. Observed in a few spots localized in pairs on the sister chromatids of mitotic chromosome arms and not centromeres, one on each chromatids. These foci coincide with common fragile sites and could be sites of replication fork stalling. The foci are frequently interlinked through BLM-associated ultra-fine DNA bridges. Following aphidicolin treatment, targets chromatid gaps and breaks.	FUNCTION: Required for maintenance of chromosomal stability (PubMed:11239453, PubMed:14517836).

FUNCTION: Capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 phases. Acts as a tumor suppressor. Binds to MDM2 and blocks its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by sequestering it in the nucleolus. This inhibits the oncogenic action of MDM2 by blocking MDM2-induced degradation of p53 and enhancing p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis. Also induces G2 arrest and apoptosis in a p53-independent manner by preventing the activation of cyclin B1/CDC2 complexes. Binds to BCL6 and down-regulates BCL6-induced transcriptional repression. Binds to E2F1 and MYC and blocks their transcriptional activator activity but has no effect on MYC transcriptional repression. Binds to TOP1/TOPOI and stimulates its activity. This complex binds to rRNA gene promoters and may play a role in rRNA transcription and/or maturation. Interacts with NPM1/B23 and promotes its polyubiquitination and degradation, thus inhibiting rRNA processing. Plays a role in inhibiting ribosome biogenesis, perhaps by binding to the nucleolar localization sequence of transcription termination factor TTF1, and thereby preventing nucleolar localization of TTF1 (By similarity). Interacts with COMMD1 and promotes its 'Lys63'-linked polyubiquitination. Interacts with UBE2I/UBC9 and enhances sumoylation of a number of its binding partners including MDM2 and E2F1. Binds to HUWE1 and represses its ubiquitin ligase activity.

Note=Colocalizes with the adrenergic receptors, ADREN1A and ADREN1B, at the nuclear membrane of cardiac myocytes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21279}.	FUNCTION: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:37991948). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:37991948). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:37991948). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:37991948). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:37991948). Signaling is mediated via phospholipase C-beta-dependent inositol lipid hydrolysis for signal propagation: activates phospholipase C-beta: following GPCR activation, GNAQ activates PLC-beta (PLCB1, PLCB2, PLCB3 or PLCB4), leading to production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (PubMed:37991948). Required for platelet activation (By similarity). Regulates B-cell selection and survival and is required to prevent B-cell-dependent autoimmunity (By similarity). Regulates chemotaxis of BM-derived neutrophils and dendritic cells (in vitro) (By similarity). Transduces FFAR4 signaling in response to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (PubMed:27852822). Together with GNA11, required for heart development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27852822, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37991948}.	adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007189]; blood coagulation [GO:0007596]; entrainment of circadian clock [GO:0009649]; G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007213]; glutamate receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007215]; neuropeptide signaling pathway [GO:0007218]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled glutamate receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007206]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; phospholipase C-activating serotonin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007208]; phototransduction, visible light [GO:0007603]; protein stabilization [GO:0050821]; regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0060828]; regulation of platelet activation [GO:0010543]; response to prostaglandin E [GO:0034695]	IPR000654;IPR001019;IPR011025;IPR027417;	PF00503;

FUNCTION: Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for the cytokine KITLG/SCF and plays an essential role in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, hematopoiesis, stem cell maintenance, gametogenesis, mast cell development, migration and function, and in melanogenesis. In response to KITLG/SCF binding, KIT can activate several signaling pathways. Phosphorylates PIK3R1, PLCG1, SH2B2/APS and CBL. Activates the AKT1 signaling pathway by phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activated KIT also transmits signals via GRB2 and activation of RAS, RAF1 and the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1. Promotes activation of STAT family members STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. KIT signaling is modulated by protein phosphatases, and by rapid internalization and degradation of the receptor. Activated KIT promotes phosphorylation of the protein phosphatases PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPRU, and of the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Promotes phosphorylation of PIK3R1, CBL, CRK (isoform Crk-II), LYN, MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1, PLCG1, SRC and SHC1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10397721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12444928, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12511554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12878163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17904548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21135090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21640708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7520444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9528781}.	actin cytoskeleton organization [GO:0030036]; B cell differentiation [GO:0030183]; cell chemotaxis [GO:0060326]; cell migration [GO:0016477]; cytokine-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0019221]; detection of mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception of sound [GO:0050910]; digestive tract development [GO:0048565]; ectopic germ cell programmed cell death [GO:0035234]; embryonic hemopoiesis [GO:0035162]; epithelial cell proliferation [GO:0050673]; erythrocyte differentiation [GO:0030218]; erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0038162]; Fc receptor signaling pathway [GO:0038093]; germ cell migration [GO:0008354]; glycosphingolipid metabolic process [GO:0006687]; hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation [GO:0002244]; hematopoietic stem cell migration [GO:0035701]; hemopoiesis [GO:0030097]; immature B cell differentiation [GO:0002327]; inflammatory response [GO:0006954]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; Kit signaling pathway [GO:0038109]; lamellipodium assembly [GO:0030032]; lymphoid progenitor cell differentiation [GO:0002320]; male gonad development [GO:0008584]; mast cell chemotaxis [GO:0002551]; mast cell degranulation [GO:0043303]; mast cell differentiation [GO:0060374]; mast cell proliferation [GO:0070662]; megakaryocyte development [GO:0035855]; melanocyte adhesion [GO:0097326]; melanocyte differentiation [GO:0030318]; melanocyte migration [GO:0097324]; myeloid progenitor cell differentiation [GO:0002318]; negative regulation of developmental process [GO:0051093]; negative regulation of programmed cell death [GO:0043069]; negative regulation of reproductive process [GO:2000242]; ovarian follicle development [GO:0001541]; pigmentation [GO:0043473]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of colon smooth muscle contraction [GO:1904343]; positive regulation of dendritic cell cytokine production [GO:0002732]; positive regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0051091]; positive regulation of long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity [GO:0048170]; positive regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043410]; positive regulation of mast cell cytokine production [GO:0032765]; positive regulation of mast cell proliferation [GO:0070668]; positive regulation of Notch signaling pathway [GO:0045747]; positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction [GO:0051897]; positive regulation of pseudopodium assembly [GO:0031274]; positive regulation of pyloric antrum smooth muscle contraction [GO:0120072]; positive regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT [GO:0046427]; positive regulation of small intestine smooth muscle contraction [GO:1904349]; positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein [GO:0042531]; positive regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell differentiation [GO:1905065]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; regulation of bile acid metabolic process [GO:1904251]; regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]; regulation of cell shape [GO:0008360]; response to cadmium ion [GO:0046686]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; somatic stem cell population maintenance [GO:0035019]; spermatid development [GO:0007286]; spermatogenesis [GO:0007283]; stem cell differentiation [GO:0048863]; stem cell population maintenance [GO:0019827]; T cell differentiation [GO:0030217]; tongue development [GO:0043586]; visual learning [GO:0008542]	IPR007110;IPR036179;IPR013783;IPR003599;IPR003598;IPR013151;IPR011009;IPR000719;IPR017441;IPR050122;IPR027263;IPR001245;IPR008266;IPR020635;IPR001824;	PF00047;PF07714;

FUNCTION: Transmembrane serine/threonine kinase forming with the TGF-beta type I serine/threonine kinase receptor, TGFBR1, the non-promiscuous receptor for the TGF-beta cytokines TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3. Transduces the TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 signal from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and thus regulates a plethora of physiological and pathological processes including cell cycle arrest in epithelial and hematopoietic cells, control of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, immunosuppression and carcinogenesis. The formation of the receptor complex composed of 2 TGFBR1 and 2 TGFBR2 molecules symmetrically bound to the cytokine dimer results in the phosphorylation and activation of TGFBR1 by the constitutively active TGFBR2. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 which dissociates from the receptor and interacts with SMAD4. The SMAD2-SMAD4 complex is subsequently translocated to the nucleus where it modulates the transcription of the TGF-beta-regulated genes. This constitutes the canonical SMAD-dependent TGF-beta signaling cascade. Also involved in non-canonical, SMAD-independent TGF-beta signaling pathways. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7774578}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Has transforming growth factor beta-activated receptor activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8635485}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has transforming growth factor beta-activated receptor activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8635485}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 3]: Binds TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 in the picomolar affinity range without the participation of additional receptors.

Note=Membrane attachment is essential for promotion of neuron-like differentiation and cell proliferation arrest through specific activation of the MAP kinase pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043}.	FUNCTION: Neuronal receptor tyrosine kinase that is essentially and transiently expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems and plays an important role in the genesis and differentiation of the nervous system (PubMed:11121404, PubMed:11387242, PubMed:16317043, PubMed:17274988, PubMed:30061385, PubMed:34646012, PubMed:34819673). Also acts as a key thinness protein involved in the resistance to weight gain: in hypothalamic neurons, controls energy expenditure acting as a negative regulator of white adipose tissue lipolysis and sympathetic tone to fine-tune energy homeostasis (By similarity). Following activation by ALKAL2 ligand at the cell surface, transduces an extracellular signal into an intracellular response (PubMed:30061385, PubMed:33411331, PubMed:34646012, PubMed:34819673). In contrast, ALKAL1 is not a potent physiological ligand for ALK (PubMed:34646012). Ligand-binding to the extracellular domain induces tyrosine kinase activation, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PubMed:34819673). Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif (PubMed:15226403, PubMed:16878150). Induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 (PubMed:15226403, PubMed:16878150). ALK activation may also be regulated by pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MDK) (PubMed:11278720, PubMed:11809760, PubMed:12107166, PubMed:12122009). PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:11278720, PubMed:11809760, PubMed:12107166). MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction (PubMed:12122009). Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase (PubMed:15226403, PubMed:16878150). Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK (PubMed:15226403, PubMed:16878150). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97793, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30061385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33411331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34646012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34819673}.	adult behavior [GO:0030534]; cell surface receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway [GO:0007169]; energy homeostasis [GO:0097009]; hippocampus development [GO:0021766]; negative regulation of lipid catabolic process [GO:0050995]; neuron development [GO:0048666]; peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation [GO:0038083]; phosphorylation [GO:0016310]; positive regulation of dendrite development [GO:1900006]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]; regulation of dopamine receptor signaling pathway [GO:0060159]; regulation of neuron differentiation [GO:0045664]; response to environmental enrichment [GO:0090648]; response to stress [GO:0006950]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; swimming behavior [GO:0036269]	IPR055163;IPR013320;IPR011009;IPR036055;IPR002172;IPR000998;IPR000719;IPR017441;IPR050122;IPR001245;IPR008266;IPR020635;IPR002011;	PF12810;PF00629;PF07714;

FUNCTION: Polynucleotide kinase that can phosphorylate the 5'-hydroxyl groups of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and double-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids. dsRNA is phosphorylated more efficiently than dsDNA, and the RNA component of a DNA:RNA hybrid is phosphorylated more efficiently than the DNA component. Plays a key role in both tRNA splicing and mRNA 3'-end formation. Component of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex: phosphorylates the 5'-terminus of the tRNA 3'-exon during tRNA splicing; this phosphorylation event is a prerequisite for the subsequent ligation of the two exon halves and the production of a mature tRNA (PubMed:24766809, PubMed:24766810). Its role in tRNA splicing and maturation is required for cerebellar development (PubMed:24766809, PubMed:24766810). Component of the pre-mRNA cleavage complex II (CF-II), which seems to be required for mRNA 3'-end formation. Also phosphorylates the 5'-terminus of exogenously introduced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which is a necessary prerequisite for their incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). However, endogenous siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are produced by the cleavage of dsRNA precursors by DICER1 already contain a 5'-phosphate group, so this protein may be dispensible for normal RNA-mediated gene silencing. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17495927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18648070, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24766809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24766810}.	cerebellar cortex development [GO:0021695]; global gene silencing by mRNA cleavage [GO:0098795]; mRNA 3'-end processing [GO:0031124]; RISC complex assembly [GO:0070922]; tRNA splicing, via endonucleolytic cleavage and ligation [GO:0006388]	IPR028606;IPR045116;IPR010655;IPR038238;IPR032324;IPR038239;IPR032319;IPR027417;	PF06807;PF16573;PF16575;

Phosphorylates BRCA1, CHEK1, MCM2, RAD17, RBBP8, RPA2, SMC1 and p53/TP53, which collectively inhibit DNA replication and mitosis and promote DNA repair, recombination and apoptosis (PubMed:11114888, PubMed:11418864, PubMed:11865061, PubMed:21777809, PubMed:23273981, PubMed:25083873, PubMed:9925639). Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX at sites of DNA damage, thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism (PubMed:11673449). Required for FANCD2 ubiquitination (PubMed:15314022). Critical for maintenance of fragile site stability and efficient regulation of centrosome duplication (PubMed:12526805). Acts as a regulator of the S-G2 transition by restricting the activity of CDK1 during S-phase to prevent premature entry into G2 (PubMed:30139873). Acts as a regulator of the nuclear envelope integrity in response to DNA damage and stress (PubMed:25083873, PubMed:37788673, PubMed:37832547). Acts as a mechanical stress sensor at the nuclear envelope: relocalizes to the nuclear envelope in response to mechanical stress and mediates a checkpoint via phosphorylation of CHEK1 (PubMed:25083873). Also promotes nuclear envelope rupture in response to DNA damage by mediating phosphorylation of LMNA at 'Ser-282', leading to lamin disassembly (PubMed:37832547). Involved in the inflammatory response to genome instability and double-stranded DNA breaks: acts by localizing to micronuclei arising from genome instability and catalyzing phosphorylation of LMNA at 'Ser-395', priming LMNA for subsequent phosphorylation by CDK1 and micronuclei envelope rupture (PubMed:37788673). The rupture of micronuclear envelope triggers the cGAS-STING pathway thereby activating the type I interferon response and innate immunity (PubMed:37788673).

FUNCTION: Involved in diverse cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, protein chaperoning, histone assembly, cell proliferation, and regulation of tumor suppressors p53/TP53 and ARF. Binds ribosome presumably to drive ribosome nuclear export. Associated with nucleolar ribonucleoprotein structures and bind single-stranded nucleic acids. Acts as a chaperonin for the core histones H3, H2B and H4. Stimulates APEX1 endonuclease activity on apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) double-stranded DNA but inhibits APEX1 endonuclease activity on AP single-stranded RNA. May exert a control of APEX1 endonuclease activity within nucleoli devoted to repair AP on rDNA and the removal of oxidized rRNA molecules. In concert with BRCA2, regulates centrosome duplication.

In vitro activates transcription of target genes via direct binding to the CRE site (PubMed:17178827). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8BH52, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17178827}.	cartilage development [GO:0051216]; chondrocyte differentiation [GO:0002062]; endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0006888]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]; response to endoplasmic reticulum stress [GO:0034976]; response to unfolded protein [GO:0006986]	IPR004827;IPR046347;	PF00170;

FUNCTION: Component of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) that function as heterotetrameric, ligand-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability and voltage-dependent block by Mg(2+) (PubMed:20890276, PubMed:23933818, PubMed:23933819, PubMed:23933820, PubMed:24504326, PubMed:26875626, PubMed:26919761, PubMed:28242877, PubMed:36117210, PubMed:38538865, PubMed:8768735). NMDARs participate in synaptic plasticity for learning and memory formation by contributing to the slow phase of excitatory postsynaptic current, long-term synaptic potentiation, and learning (By similarity). Channel activation requires binding of the neurotransmitter L-glutamate to the GluN2 subunit, glycine or D-serine binding to the GluN1 subunit, plus membrane depolarization to eliminate channel inhibition by Mg(2+) (PubMed:23933818, PubMed:23933819, PubMed:23933820, PubMed:24504326, PubMed:26875626, PubMed:26919761, PubMed:27288002, PubMed:28095420, PubMed:28105280, PubMed:28126851, PubMed:28182669, PubMed:29644724, PubMed:38307912, PubMed:8768735). NMDARs mediate simultaneously the potasium efflux and the influx of calcium and sodium (By similarity). Each GluN2 subunit confers differential attributes to channel properties, including activation, deactivation and desensitization kinetics, pH sensitivity, Ca2(+) permeability, and binding to allosteric modulators (PubMed:26875626, PubMed:26919761).

FUNCTION: Probable regulator of the Hippo/SWH (Sav/Wts/Hpo) signaling pathway, a signaling pathway that plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis.

FUNCTION: Receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the development and the maturation of the central and peripheral nervous systems through regulation of proliferation, differentiation and survival of sympathetic and nervous neurons. High affinity receptor for NGF which is its primary ligand (PubMed:1281417, PubMed:15488758, PubMed:17196528, PubMed:1849459, PubMed:1850821, PubMed:22649032, PubMed:27445338, PubMed:8325889). Can also bind and be activated by NTF3/neurotrophin-3. However, NTF3 only supports axonal extension through NTRK1 but has no effect on neuron survival (By similarity). Upon dimeric NGF ligand-binding, undergoes homodimerization, autophosphorylation and activation (PubMed:1281417). Recruits, phosphorylates and/or activates several downstream effectors including SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 and PLCG1 that regulate distinct overlapping signaling cascades driving cell survival and differentiation. Through SHC1 and FRS2 activates a GRB2-Ras-MAPK cascade that regulates cell differentiation and survival. Through PLCG1 controls NF-Kappa-B activation and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival. Through SHC1 and SH2B1 controls a Ras-PI3 kinase-AKT1 signaling cascade that is also regulating survival.

Lysosome targeting also depends on interaction with MEAK7. Translocates to the lysosome membrane in the presence of TM4SF5 (PubMed:30956113). The mTORC2 complex localizes to membranes: mTORC2 is active at the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum membrane and lysosomes (PubMed:21867682). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JLN9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18497260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20381137, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21867682, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29750193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30956113}.	FUNCTION: Serine/threonine protein kinase which is a central regulator of cellular metabolism, growth and survival in response to hormones, growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:32561715, PubMed:34519269, PubMed:37751742). MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:17517883, PubMed:18372248, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:30171069, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:37751742). Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity).
